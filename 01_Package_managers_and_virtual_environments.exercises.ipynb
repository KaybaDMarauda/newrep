    "Let's say, you need to analyse a metagenomic dataset (DNA originating from different organisms). You want to start with a taxonomic profiling, i.e. to determine what organisms are in the dataset. You discover the tool [Metaxa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21674231), one of many tools for this task. You find the [download page](https://microbiology.se/software/metaxa2/) and the [manual](https://microbiology.se/publ/metaxa2_users_guide_2.2.pdf) with detailed installation instructions. The installation sounds complicated: It requires several steps, and the tool needs a bunch of other software, like HMMER 3.1. However, you have HMMER 3.0 installed, which you need for other scripts/tools. If you install HMMER 3.1, these other tools may stop working. What should you do? This problem can be addressed using **virtual environments**.\n",

If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular package, but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.\n",
    ">The solution for this problem is to create a **virtual environment**, which is a self-contained directory tree that contains a number of **compatible packages**. Different applications can then use different virtual environments. (based on [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different tools for creating virtual environments.\n",

Luckily, there is another package program, which is focused on scientific software and has the additional advantage of creating virtual environments: [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

    "### What is a software package?\n",
    "\n",
    "A package (as in \"package manager\" and \"package management system\") is a **distribution** of software and data in archive files. Packages also contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager))\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Python package**? You learned that a Python package is a folder with Python modules and an additional `__init__.py` file ([Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)). However, when people talk about \"installing a Python package\", what they mean is a **distribution package**: An archive file that contains Python packages, modules, and other resource files that are used to distribute a software release. The archive file is what an end-user will download from the internet and install. A distribution package is more commonly referred to with the single word ‚Äúpackage‚Äù. ([packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package))\n",
    "\n",
    ">It‚Äôs important to note that the term ‚Äúpackage‚Äù in this context is being used to describe a bundle of software to be installed (i.e. as a synonym for a distribution). It does not to refer to the kind of package that you import in your Python source code (i.e. a container of modules). ([packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/))\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use a Python package?** Typically, Python modules are either executed as a script (standalone program), or imported into other Python programs as a library. Therefore, after the installation of a Python package, you will either have one (or more) new executables that you can run from the command line, or you will be able to import new modules within Python, according to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a conda package**? Conda was originally developed to solve package management challenges faced by data scientists. The conda package format is identical across platforms and operating systems. A conda package is a compressed tarball file (`.tar.bz2`) or `.conda` file that contains system libraries, Python or other modules, executable programs and other components, metadata and additional files like sample data ([docs.conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/packages.html)).\n",

It looks in the default channels, or channels from the `.condarc` configuration file ([conda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html)).\n",

E.g. if you know the name of the package, but not in which channel(s) (or by which users) it was published, you can search across all channels and platforms using: `anaconda search packagename`. This is equivalent to searching the Anaconda repository via the browser ([anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo)). This will tell you which [conda channel](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/channels.html) provides the package. In this case, it's the [bioconda channel](https://bioconda.github.io/).\n",

Activate it with `conda activate metaxa`.\n",
    "1. The command `conda install metaxa` will then download/install the required packages. If the channel with the package is not default or in your `.condarc` file, you need to specify [this channel](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html#Channel%20Customization) using the `-c` switch: `conda install -c bioconda metaxa`\n",

(Problems can still arise if you relied on additional packages like system libraries that were installed otherwise, e.g. via `apt`.) The basic commands for this approach are:\n",
    "    - `conda env export > environment.yml` ‚Üí export environment specifications (also lists pip-installed packages in this environment) ([Conda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment), [tdhopper.com](https://tdhopper.com/blog/my-python-environment-workflow-with-conda))\n",
    "    - `conda env create -f environment.yml` ‚Üí recreate environment from specifications file ([Conda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file))\n",
    "1. **Packaging**. If the software becomes more complex than a few simple scripts, this is what \"packaging\" and \"deployment\" is about ([stackexchange.com](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/308342)). You can build a `pip`-installable [Python package](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) based on `setup.py`, which is the build script for [setuptools](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/). You can distribute the package via [PyPI](https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-65edc5fe9c56), or as a `tar.gz` archive, e.g. from a GitHub repository ([example1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2/), [example2](https://dev.to/rf_schubert/how-to-create-a-pip-package-and-host-on-private-github-repo-58pa)). While building the package, you list all its dependencies, so you don't need to provide additional information to the user later. You can even provide your Python package as a conda package.\n",
    "1. **Freezing** or **containers**. Other options like [PyInstaller](https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/) (this approach is called [freezing](https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/)), or Docker (virtualization/containers).\n",

    "\n",
    "Another approach to distributing production-ready environments (with all required apps and data files) are virtual machines or containers. A popular solution is Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably in every computing environment. Containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. (based on [Docker docs](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container))\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)\">Docker</a> is free software that uses [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_containers) to execute programs in isolated virtual environments. A container image is a standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Essentially, a Docker container is a [lightweight virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization), and facilitates the deployment of software with complex dependencies and in isolated environments. This is especially helpful if your software has many dependencies, however it also introduces additional complexity ([N√ºst et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008316)). Other container systems may be even better suited for data analysis, like <a href=\"https://apptainer.org/\">Apptainer</a> (former Singularity, see e.g. <a href=\"https://pythonspeed.com/articles/containers-filesystem-data-processing/\">pythonspeed.com</a> for very brief comparison to Docker)."
